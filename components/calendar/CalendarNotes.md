Hey Garrett
This archive has added datepicker component and I need your/Sam's attention/testing here.
It was most problematic part to me because of lack clear specification about datepicker functionality.
So I took this plugin - https://air-datepicker.com/ (I proposed it to you on start) and modified as per design. Also I changed some functionality to satisfy the requirements.
Because of these modifications some of default behaviour/options (which you could find in docs) will not work. It strictly requires to use only params showed in design system.
Also timepicker fields I did as dropdowns on purpose simplify UX experience and avoid user's mistakes.
Please review/test it in detail and let me know about any issues/updates.
